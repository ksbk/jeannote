## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-22

Initial release of the Architecture Portfolio Django Template.

### Included

**Core platform**
- Django 5.2 LTS application with five domain apps: `core`, `pages`, `projects`, `services`, `contact`
- `SiteSettings` and `AboutProfile` singleton models — all public content driven from admin, zero hardcoding
- Seven pages: home, project list, project detail, about, services, contact, contact success
- Full Django admin for all models

**Projects**
- Full project case-study structure: overview, challenge, concept, process, outcome
- Gallery image model (`ProjectImage`) with type classification
- Testimonial model — per-project or site-wide
- Category filter on project list
- Featured flag for homepage display
- Per-project SEO title, meta description, and OG image

**Contact form**
- Submission saved to database on every post — no dependency on email delivery for record-keeping
- Email notification to `CONTACT_EMAIL` on submission
- Honeypot spam field
- Timing-based bot rejection (submission token with minimum age)
- Minimum message length validation
- Email-failure resilience — inquiry saved and user redirected even if SMTP fails

**Production readiness**
- `config.settings.prod` with HSTS, SSL redirect, secure cookies, `DEBUG=False`
- Cloudinary media storage for durable uploads on ephemeral platforms (Railway, Heroku)
- PostgreSQL support via `DATABASE_URL`
- Whitenoise static file serving — no CDN required
- Sentry integration — exception monitoring, opt-in via `SENTRY_DSN`
- Auto-generated XML sitemap for all pages and projects
- GA4 analytics — Measurement ID managed in admin, no code changes

**Management commands**
- `seed_demo` — idempotent starter content for new installs (SiteSettings, AboutProfile, 6 services, 4 projects, 3 testimonials)
- `seed_about` — fills blank AboutProfile fields; `--force` to overwrite
- `seed_services` — fills blank service records; `--reset` to reinitialise all
- `bootstrap_project` — creates a Project record from local files; `--dry-run` required first
- `import_project_images` — attaches gallery images to an existing project; `--dry-run` required first
- `check_content_readiness` — pre-launch audit; exits 1 if required fields are missing or at placeholder values

**Launch safety**
- `check_content_readiness` covers: site name, contact email, meta description, OG image, about headline, experience years, portrait, active services, portfolio projects
- System check `core.W001` — warns in development if email backend is still the console backend
- System check `core.W006` — warns if `CONTACT_EMAIL` is blank

**Developer tooling**
- 98-test suite (pytest + pytest-django) covering all models, views, forms, admin, and system checks
- Playwright e2e tests for contact form submission, homepage, navigation, projects, and services
- GitHub Actions CI — lint, type-check, tests, Django system check, migration drift check, deploy check, dependency drift check
- pre-commit hooks (ruff, formatting, common file checks, branch protection)
- Makefile with `health`, `check-deploy`, `smoke`, `coverage`, `reqs`, and `clean-*` targets
- Docker + Compose for local dev without installing Python on the host
- Railway deployment config (`Procfile` + `railway.toml`) ready for first deploy

**Documentation**
- `README.md` — full technical reference and deployment guide
- `SETUP.md` — buyer-facing phase-by-phase guide from fresh clone to live site
- `.env.example` — fully annotated environment configuration template
