# Buyer Setup Guide

A step-by-step checklist for taking this template from fresh install to live site.
Work through each phase in order. Everything after Phase 1 happens in the Django admin.

---

## Phase 1 — First run (local)

**Goal:** Get the site running locally so you can see it before making any changes.

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repo-url>
cd <project-directory>
uv sync --group dev

# 2. Create your environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set `SECRET_KEY`:

```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

Paste the output as the value. Leave everything else as-is for now.

```bash
# 3. Create the database
uv run python manage.py migrate

# 4. Create your admin account
uv run python manage.py createsuperuser

# 5. Load starter content so the site renders on first visit
uv run python manage.py seed_demo

# 6. Start the dev server
uv run python manage.py runserver
```

Visit **<http://127.0.0.1:8000>** and confirm the site loads.
Visit **<http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin>** and log in with the credentials you just created.

## Phase 2 — Brand and site identity

## Phase 4 — Services

### Admin → Services

Six placeholder service records are loaded by `seed_demo`. Edit them to match your
actual offering, or delete and create your own.

For each service:

| Field | What to enter |
| --- | --- |

| `icon_name` | Optional — icon identifier from your chosen icon library |
| `order` | Controls display order; lower numbers appear first |
| `active` | Uncheck to hide a service without deleting it |

---

## Phase 5 — Projects

### Admin → Projects

Four placeholder projects are loaded by `seed_demo`. Delete them and add your real work,
or add a project directly via admin.

For each project:

### Core

| Field | What to enter |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | Project name |
| `short_description` | 1–2 sentences for cards and search results (under 160 characters ideal) |

### Metadata

**Testimonials** (optional — added inline on the project record)

Each project can have testimonials attached. Add author, role, text, and optionally a photo.

### Adding many projects from local files

The `bootstrap_project` and `import_project_images` commands can create projects and
attach gallery images from local files. Both commands require absolute file paths.
Always run `--dry-run` first:

```bash
uv run python manage.py bootstrap_project \
  --dry-run \
  --title "House Aldea" \
  --category residential \
  --short-description "Private residence on a constrained urban site." \
  --cover /absolute/path/to/cover.jpg \
  --gallery /absolute/path/to/gallery-01.jpg /absolute/path/to/gallery-02.jpg

uv run python manage.py import_project_images \
  --dry-run \
  --project house-aldea \
  --gallery /absolute/path/to/gallery-03.jpg /absolute/path/to/gallery-04.jpg
```

## Phase 6 — Email

Contact form submissions are always saved to the database. To also receive email
notifications, configure an SMTP backend before going live.

There are three separate email roles in this template:

- `Site Settings.contact_email`: the public email shown on the site
- `CONTACT_EMAIL`: the inbox that receives contact-form notification emails
- `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`: the sender shown on outgoing notification emails

Open `.env` (or your production environment variables) and set:

```dotenv
# Switch to SMTP
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-smtp-username
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password

# Address in the From field of outgoing emails
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=Studio Rossi <hello@yourdomain.com>

# Address that receives contact form notifications — must be your monitored inbox
CONTACT_EMAIL=hello@yourdomain.com
```

Verify by submitting the contact form locally and checking that you receive the email.

---

## Phase 7 — Content readiness check

Run this before deploying. It scans your database for required fields that are still blank
or still set to starter/demo values:

```bash
uv run python manage.py check_content_readiness
```

Fix every warning it reports. The command exits with code 1 if any warnings remain,
so it can be added to a deployment gate if needed.

---

## Phase 8 — Production environment

Set these variables in your hosting environment (e.g. Railway → Variables):

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `SECRET_KEY` | A new unique key — do not reuse your local one |
| `DEBUG` | `False` |
| `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` | `config.settings.prod` |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://user:password@host:5432/dbname` |
| `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | `https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com` |
| `CONTACT_EMAIL` | Your monitored inbox |
| `EMAIL_BACKEND` | `django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend` |
| `EMAIL_HOST` | Your SMTP server |
| `EMAIL_PORT` | `587` |
| `EMAIL_USE_TLS` | `True` |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | Your SMTP username |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | Your SMTP password |
| `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` | `Your Name <hello@yourdomain.com>` |

After setting variables and deploying, verify production Django settings:

```bash
make check-deploy
# or: uv run python manage.py check --deploy
```

Fix any warnings before accepting live traffic.

---

## Phase 9 — Go live

Run the content readiness check one final time against production:

```bash
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.prod uv run python manage.py check_content_readiness
```

Then smoke-check the live site:

```bash
SMOKE_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com make smoke
```

This confirms the main pages return HTTP 200 and no obvious errors appear.
